        <h2>Succes is for YOU?</h2>
        <p>Success is everyone’s mission. Life is full of challenges and opportunities, but only for those who actually struggle to grab the opportunities and overcome the challenges. Hard work and dedication are the only mantra in the journey to success. Without being passionate and the willingness to work hard, no one can achieve success. There can be several occasions when you may have to deliver Speech on Success. We share here different samples of success speech that will help you in making an impressive speech to the audience. At school level, you may use the short speech on success at occasions like ‘Teacher’s Day’, ‘Annual Day,’ etc. You can take inspiration from our long speech on success for college level or even for the corporate level occasions. We don’t use jargons or complicated sentences, instead the language used in these sample speeches are simple, but highly effective.</p>

        <h2>The journey to succes!</h2>
        <p class="full-border">I have been given the opportunity to host the programme this year and I am pretty enthusiastic to address everyone as this may be my last interaction with many of you. Well, emotions apart, I would like to utilise this platform to share some secrets of success with you all. So far success for you must be to successfully complete the assignments on time, attend the lectures, never miss classes, maintain required attendance, give semester exams and of course to fair well in the exams. But life in reality is a bigger sea; in fact it’s an ocean, which you will have to swim across. Sometimes life may hit you as hard as a brick does; but don’t lose hope. Always believe that those who don’t give up can only meet the success ultimately. But if I ask you to define success, many of you must say ‘its name, fame, recognition, big house, car, fat bank balance, etc.’ But I would say, the interpretation of success may change from person to person. The ultimate success is happiness and satisfaction. It’s important that you pursue your passion and love. Don’t follow other’s dream; instead follow your goals and dreams. For you are not someone else; you have your identity and capacity and work accordingly in order to achieve the real success. Always remember that the definition of success will vary from person to person and your feelings are your own responsibility. So always stay motivated to do better than the past and the most important thing is that you should never compare yourself with others. Do more and achieve more.</p>

        <h2>Create your own path!</h2>
        <p>I can understand that many of you must not even have decided about your career goals. Some of you might go for further studies, some may join the corporate world and some of you may join your family business. Each option would come with its own prospects and challenges. You must only concentrate on your activities and must not imagine the consequences. Don’t get disheartened, if you fail initially, instead keep trying. Remember that your mistakes give you valuable lessons in the end and also help you choose the right path. We have heard about several stories in our childhood such as the ‘story of ant, who tries to climb the mountain’ or ‘slow and steady wins the race’ and many more. The moral of all these stories is common that you should keep trying until you succeed and no matter you are slow but if you are steady, you are certainly going to win. When something is important enough you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.</p>

        <h2>Never give up!</h2>
        <p class="full-border">It is also important that you give yourself the credit of the success that you achieve after putting your effort and energy. It’s a very critical aspect because majority of the people give maximum credit to good luck or fortune; such people are not fearless, instead they are always worried about failures or mishaps. Instead of preparing themselves for bad days, they pray for a continued success. You must always treat yourself with kindness and encourage yourself along the journey of your life. Celebration of every victory whether small or big will boost your enthusiasm and encourage you to achieve more in life. I would also like to point here, some people are emotional and sensitive to the extent that they stop trying if they fail. You must understand that success and failure are the two sides of the same coin. Success is not a hereditary property of any insectionidual. Even someone who takes over the ancestral successful business has to work harder to preserve that success. Thus, you must not get disheartened or discouraged even if you fail. Even then we all want to taste it and in the pursuit of success, we sacrifice our comfort and ease. I am sure many of you would be very ardent in the pursuit of your career objectives, especially after getting inspired from the success and glory of the people around. Though we get inspired and start dreaming of a worthy and honorable post, but there are only a few lucky ones who get success and those who do not get to value success become disheartened. Like every year, we have gathered here once again to celebrate the annual function of our college and today being the last day of the celebration we will have lots of fun including eating, dancing, merry-making, etc. This day is all the more important for us as this is the last year for the final year students.</p>

        <p>Even then we all want to taste it and in the pursuit of success, we sacrifice our comfort and ease. I am sure many of you would be very ardent in the pursuit of your career objectives, especially after getting inspired from the success and glory of the people around. Though we get inspired and start dreaming of a worthy and honorable post, but there are only a few lucky ones who get success and those who do not get to value success become disheartened. It’s never wise and advisable to give up on your ambitions if you face failures, rather use your failures as the stepping stones to gain success. If you wouldn’t fail in life, how will you feel what it is to be successful in life? So prepare yourself for the worse and leave no stone unturned in realizing your aims. There will be times of recurrent failures, but one day success will definitely touch your feet. And, if at any point in your life you feel the need to come back to your teachers, never feel hesitant to do so. We will always be there for you. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great.</p>
