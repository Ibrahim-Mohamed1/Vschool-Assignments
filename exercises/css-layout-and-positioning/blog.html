                When someone introduces you to another person, there tends to be a very good reason for it. 
                The top people take advantage of these introductions because they know that they might lead 
                to great opportunities. It is easy to blow off an intro or not follow-up. Doing so is a missed 
                chance to create a meaningful relationship with a like-minded person. The best people are 
                admired by those around them. This could be due to their high-quality work, their personal 
                interactions, or, likely, both. They remember names, they follow-up when they say they are 
                going to, and they take little steps to create stronger relationships with those around them. 
                Something as small as sending a text after a surgery or a congratulations after a new job offer 
                can make a big difference. The brightest people are always learning. There is endless knowledge, 
                and, in order to continue to improve and learn more, reading is a necessity. Most people make 
                excuses as to why they do not read very much. The best people do not allow themselves to make 
                excuses, and instead prioritize personal learning. I've personally made it my goal to read a 
                book a week. Here are a few of my top books to read in 2018. In order to stay effective and 
                energetic, health has to be a top priority. Otherwise, you will go through life with less kick 
                each day. The best people also make no excuses for their health. They make conscious decisions 
                to eat well and exercise. They care about their bodies and take care of themselves in order to 
                propel their success. This focus on health also gets them feeling better about how they look 
                day-in and day-out. Ambiguity is difficult. When the path is not spelled out, it means that you 
                have to make more challenging decisions. The top 1 percent of people love ambiguity. It gives 
                them an opportunity to be creative and stand out from those around them. They do not mind making 
                hard decisions because they know that doing so will lead to higher impact, and it is more 
                rewarding.

                If you cannot look back six months and see a drastically different person, then you 
                are not growing fast enough. This is especially true early in life. The most successful self 
                employed people are constantly learning and adapting. They let their barriers down and are 
                always willing to change things about themselves in order to be better, happier and more 
                productive. This can be extremely challenging for many because it means letting your guard down 
                and being vulnerable. We see ourselves in a certain light, and we make our decisions accordingly. 
                Changing means accepting that our past choices might not have been the best. When those past 
                actions are tied up with our ego, it can be especially difficult to move past them. The best 
                people are able to do so in stride. Goal setting is underrated. Most people do not take the time 
                because they do not think it is a worthwhile endeavor. The value is that it helps align actions, 
                Setting goals also gets you thinking about what you are really trying to accomplish and why. Those 
                that are able to set goals tend to be much more productive and focused in their efforts. This 
                allows for a higher level of output, greater success, and more impact. We are the average of the 
                five people we surround ourselves with the most. Therefore, it is critical to be around great 
                people. There is a reason that many successful people tend to be friends before rising to fame. 
                They have made an effort, from the onset, to be around others who can motivate them and propel 
                their success. It can be challenging to abandon or step back from destructive friends that we 
                have been close with for long periods of time.

                The most accomplished people have been able to do so, though, because they know that there are 
                many amazing people out there for them to spend time with. Persistence is also very underrated. 
                It is easy to workout one time or to send a few emails. It is also easy to take on an 80-hour 
                week once. Pushing yourself consistently, though, is an extreme challenge. It is where 99 percent 
                of people drop off. It is when nobody is looking that effort matters the most. The best people work 
                hard and smart consistently. They have increasing returns to scale and their efforts compound over 
                time. Successful athletes do not suddenly emerge. They have been working for years and years on 
                their craft to reach their current point. It is easy to believe successful people reached that 
                level through luck or raw talent. That is almost never the case, though. Persistence over time is 
                an absolute must. The top people do not spend their lives living other people's dreams. They pursue 
                their own passions. That gives them the energy to attack each day with all that they have. It also 
                allows them to think more independently. After getting over the fact that you cannot please 
                everyone and that you have to think for yourself, life becomes a lot better. Spending time doing 
                what you love enables the highest quality of work and it makes staying consistent significantly 
                easier. Many people blame others for their shortcomings. Doing so might have immediate benefits, 
                but it is detrimental in the long run. Neglecting accountability prevents personal growth and, 
                over time, it develops a bad reputation for yourself. The best people take full responsibility 
                for their actions. This garners more respect and allows them to grow at much faster rates.

                everyone and that you have to think for yourself, life becomes a lot better. Spending time doing 
                what you love enables the highest quality of work and it makes staying consistent significantly 
                easier. Many people blame others for their shortcomings. Doing so might have immediate benefits, 
                but it is detrimental in the long run. Neglecting accountability prevents personal growth and, 
                over time, it develops a bad reputation for yourself. The best people take full responsibility 
                for their actions. This garners more respect and allows them to grow at much faster rates.
